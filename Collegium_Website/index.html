With the magic and monsters of the D&D world mixed with the mythology and deities of Rome, who knows what will happen? You could fight skeleton gladiators in the arena for the Glory of the Emperor, complete epic quests for the Guild, or build an empire of your own to conquer Rome. Anything is possible in Collegium!</i>

                        Since she was a child, Michelle Mannisto has loved telling stories. After experiencing D&D for the first time, Michelle determined that she loved telling stories for RPG, particularly with her friends. Thus, her career as a Dungeon Master (DM) began!                       <br>
                        <br>
                        Michelle can be found in New Glarus, WI, with her husband, snail, two dogs, two rabbits, eight fish, and twelve guinea pigs. She is a GIS Specialist with a Bachelor’s Degree in Digital Design and Animation, a Bachelor’s Degree in Geography, and a Bachelor’s Degree in GIS with a minor in Geospatial Intelligence (phew!). Michelle works at a non-profit called Congressional Communities and volunteers at her local church and another non-profit called Shepherd’s Watch.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In her spare time, Michelle like to take Udemy courses on a variety of topics, read fiction and non-fiction novels, crochet gifts for friends and family, loom knit on occasion, and, of course, cuddle with furry family members! Michelle also owns a small business called Grinning Moose Productions, LLC, which is dedicated to helping people tell their stories with hand-made jewelry.
