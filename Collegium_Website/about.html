                    Collegium is the world. It means “guild” in Latin. It is similar to the Mediterranean and Europe. Mountains rise up on the fringes, preventing exploration to the far East and North except for the most intrepid adventurer. The dwarves have built vast cave systems in the mountains, and that is where the majority of the dwarf population lives. The Aljan, on the other hand, live in the Northernmost wilds and scattered Northern islands. A thousand years ago, a peace treaty between the Roman Empire and Aljin al Baria put the millennia-old war to rest. When the offspring of that peace treaty disappeared, the peace became even more fragile, maintained by a lineage of Calyculi Pacis, Shells of Peace. Unfortunately, the lineage has not been fruitful, with each Tortle dedicating their life to peace rather than continuing their line. This leaves only one Tortle left, Antiquus Pacislator, to keep the peace. However, he is nearing the end of his life and will not be able to keep the peace for much longer. Era Pacis is ending, Era Bellae Secundae is beginning.
